### Project Overview
This data analysis project explores a fictional insurance dataset using Excel for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis, followed by Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard. The goal was to identify trends in patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and their impact on medical charges. Key variables analyzed include age group, BMI category, smoking status, region, and number of children.

To simulate a real-world business scenario, I collaborated with ChatGPT acting as both a Product Manager and a Stakeholder to define objectives, KPIs, and reporting requirements. The entire process—from raw data to final dashboard—was completed without following YouTube tutorials, showcasing my independent problem-solving skills and ability to deliver a data project from start to finish. This project highlights my proficiency in both Excel analysis and Power BI visualization.
